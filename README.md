Assignment Instructions:
You are given a medical cost dataset named insurance.csv. You are a ML engineer working in an insurance company.
The dataset contains the following variables:
Independent Variables:
age: age of primary beneficiary
sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
smoker: Smoking
region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
Dependent Variable:
charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
The Ask:
Analyse the given dataset and build a NN/DNN to predict the medical cost incurred by individuals.
1. Perform an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and provide the preliminary investigation of the dataset
by discovering atleast five patterns in the data.
2. Perform all the steps that are crucial for ensuring that the data fed into your models is of high quality and
suitable for your needs.
3. Build a neural network following the 5 steps in the NN model life-cycle as shown in figure1 below.
4. Use TensorBoard for visualization of model performance.
5. Write a conclusion and recommendation.
